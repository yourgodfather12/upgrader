This script is designed to automate the process of upgrading Python scripts located within a specified folder. It utilizes various tools and APIs to enhance the readability and functionality of Python scripts.

Features

Upgrade Python Scripts: Automatically scans a selected folder and its subfolders for Python scripts and upgrades them.
Backup Option: Provides an option to create backup copies of the original scripts before making any modifications.
Code Formatting: Utilizes Black, a Python code formatter, to ensure consistent and readable code.
AI Suggestions: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 to suggest improvements and enhancements to the scripts.

Dependencies

Python 3.x
tkinter library (for GUI)
openai library (for accessing GPT-3 API)
subprocess module (for executing shell commands)
os module (for file and directory operations)
shutil module (for file operations)
threading module (for running tasks concurrently)
logging module (for logging errors and status messages)

Usage

Run the script.
Click on the "Select Folder" button and choose the folder containing the Python scripts you want to upgrade.
Optionally, check the "Create Backup" checkbox to create backup copies of the original scripts.
The script will process each Python file found in the selected folder and its subfolders.
Progress will be displayed in the GUI, and any upgrades made to the scripts will be shown in the preview box.
Once the upgrade process is complete, a message will indicate the completion.

Logging

The script logs its activities to the upgrade.log file located in the same directory as the script. You can review this log file for detailed information about the upgrade process, including any errors encountered.

Notes
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify files within the selected folder.
The script utilizes external tools such as Black and OpenAI's GPT-3 API. Make sure you have installed and configured these dependencies properly.
